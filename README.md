# gym-fog

The implemented gym-fog is a custom [OpenAi Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment for the simulation of a fog-cloud infrastructure. 

# Installation

```bash
cd gym-fog
pip install -e .
```

## How does it work?

The implemented environment is based on a previously presented Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Please see `gym-fog/milp` for further details. 

The complete RL environment has been designed: actions, observations, reward function. 

If you would like to know further details about our gym-fog, please read our papers mentioned below.
